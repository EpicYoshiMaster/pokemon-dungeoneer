# Pokémon Dungeoneer

Pokémon Dungeoneer is a tool for generating and analyzing the dungeons of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky.

## This is cool and all... but where's the actual dungeon algorithm stuff?

You'll want to check out [dungeon-mystery](https://github.com/EpicYoshiMaster/dungeon-mystery), my TypeScript implementation of the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky dungeon algorithm.

## Big Thank You

This project is heavily inspired by Corvimae's amazing [Pokémon Ranger](https://github.com/corvimae/pokemon-ranger) tool.
